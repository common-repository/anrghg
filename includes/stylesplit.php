/**
 * Outputs the rest of the internal CSS for public pages.

 * @since 1.0.1 Split off `styles.php`
 * Else Apache fails to parse adminbin request: Request is too long
 * (length is 84837, maximum length is 65535) at
 * /usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel/AdminBin/Server.pm line 162.
 * @since 1.6.10 Rename function from `anrghg_other_internal_styles()`.
 *
 * @since 1.16.4 Cancel splitting since the technical limitation does not apply
 * any longer, so this CSS is reunited in a single place for maintainability.
 * @see ./styles.php
